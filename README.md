# EMOTION DETECTION FROM BENGALI TEXT BASED ON WORD SENSE DISAMBIGUATION 


Develop a system that would detect the correct emotion (as Positive, Negative, and Neutral distinctly) imparted by a paragraph containing polysemous words based on the correct sense. In order to accomplish this, we will generate a collection of Bengali text data, employ supervised learning techniques, and compare the results with another comparable research in the field.
The work represents a new dataset consisting of 30 polysemy words, where each word carries 3 distinct senses associated with 3 distinct emotions (positive, negative, neutral) and each sense consists of 30 distinct paragraphs, which can be also used in future in any work with Bengali polysemy words. 
The work was completed in six months by a team of three peoples, endeavoured to detect emotions in Bengali sentences using advanced NLP techniques, with a specific focus on addressing the challenges posed by Bengali polysemy.
